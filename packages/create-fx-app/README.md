# `create-fx-app` CLI

Quickly start a new FX project with everything set up for you. `create-fx-app` is just a shortcut for running `npx create-next-app` followed by `npm i -D @founding/fx` and `npx fx init`.

```bash
npx create-fx-app
```

To create a new app in a specific folder, you can send a name as an argument. For example, the following command will create an app called `blog-app` in a folder with the same name:

```bash
npx create-fx-app blog-app
```
