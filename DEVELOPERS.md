## Development Setup

### Installing Dependencies

Before you can build FX, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Running FX Locally

1. Clone your Github forked repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<github_username>/fx.git
```

2. Change into the FX directory and install the dependencies:

```sh
cd fx && npm i
```

3. Create a local FX application for development:

```sh
npm run reset:local
```

4. You can now run FX commands in your local project under `/packages/local`

```sh
cd packages/local
npx fx <command>

# Or add a generator locally
npx fx add ../../generators/auth/index.ts
```

### When working on a Generator

When working on a generator, you may make file changes and run `npx fx add <path/to/generator>` without having to worry about ts compilation. FX will automatically transpile your generator during runtime.

### When working on the FX CLI

The FX repository is managed as a [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) monorepo.

When working on the FX packages (anything under `packages/devkit`, `packages/fx`, `packages/create-fx-app`) you'll need to make sure your files are correctly linked to always be working on the latest version.

> Whenever a installation happens in any of the `packages`, you'll need to manually relink files with `npm run reset:links`. This occurs most frequently when you run a generator that has a `install` step.

On top of linking, file changes also need to be recompiled when working in anything under `packages` directory. The following dev command can be used to watch any changes and recompile in the background:

```sh
npm run dev
```

There's a lot we need to do to make local development work easier. We also need to add tests ðŸ¤«
